Certainly! Here’s a **step-by-step breakdown** for deploying a Rust web backend, with **clear comments explaining why each step is needed**. This is designed for non-coders to follow and understand the purpose behind each action.

## **Step-by-Step Rust Web Backend Deployment (with Explanations)**

---

### **1. Install Prerequisites**

**Why:**  
You need the Rust toolchain to build and run Rust programs. Git is optional but useful for version control.

**How:**
- **Install Rust:**  
  Go to [https://rustup.rs](https://rustup.rs) and follow the instructions,  
  or run in your terminal:
  ```sh
  curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
  ```
- **(Optional) Install Git:**  
  Download from [https://git-scm.com/](https://git-scm.com/)  
  *Why:* Git helps you manage and share your code.

---

### **2. Create a New Rust Project**

**Why:**  
This sets up a new folder with all the files needed for a Rust application.

**How:**
```sh
cargo new my-backend --bin
cd my-backend
```
- `cargo new my-backend --bin`: Creates a new Rust project named `my-backend` with a binary (executable) target.
- `cd my-backend`: Move into your new project directory.

---

### **3. Add Dependencies**

**Why:**  
You need extra libraries (called “crates” in Rust) to build a web server and handle HTTP requests.

**How:**
- Open the `Cargo.toml` file in your project folder.
- Add these lines under `[dependencies]`:
  ```toml
  axum = "0.7"                       # Web framework for building HTTP servers
  tokio = { version = "1", features = ["full"] }  # Async runtime required by axum
  serde = { version = "1.0", features = ["derive"] } # For serializing/deserializing data
  serde_json = "1.0"                 # For working with JSON data
  hyper = { version = "1", features = ["full"] }   # HTTP server library used by axum
  ```

---

### **4. Replace the Contents of `src/main.rs`**

**Why:**  
This code sets up a basic web server that responds to requests.  
You replace the default “Hello, world!” with real server logic.

**How:**
- Open `src/main.rs` and replace everything with:

```rust
use axum::{
    routing::get,      // For defining GET routes
    Router,            // For building the app's route tree
    response::Json,    // For sending JSON responses
};
use serde_json::{json, Value}; // For creating JSON data
use hyper::Server;             // The HTTP server

#[tokio::main]                 // Marks the async main function for the Tokio runtime
async fn main() {
    // Set up the app with a single route at "/"
    let app = Router::new().route("/", get(root));

    // Start the server on port 3000, listening on all network interfaces
    println!("Server running on http://localhost:3000");
    Server::bind(&"0.0.0.0:3000".parse().unwrap())
        .serve(app.into_make_service())
        .await
        .unwrap();
}

// Handler for GET requests to "/"
async fn root() -> Json<Value> {
    // Respond with a JSON message
    Json(json!({ "message": "KaspaTrack Rust backend is running!" }))
}
```

**What this does:**
- Sets up a web server that listens on port 3000.
- Responds to requests at `/` with a JSON message.

---

### **5. Build and Run the Server**

**Why:**  
This compiles your code and starts the web server.

**How:**
```sh
cargo run
```
- `cargo run`: Builds and runs your Rust application.

---

### **6. Test the Server**

**Why:**  
To make sure your server is running and responding as expected.

**How:**
Open a new terminal and run:
```sh
curl http://localhost:3000
```
- You should see:  
  `{"message":"KaspaTrack Rust backend is running!"}`

## **Summary Table (with Explanations)**

| Step | Command/Action | Why/Explanation |
|------|---------------|-----------------|
| 1    | Install Rust  | Needed to build and run Rust code |
| 2    | `cargo new ...` | Sets up a new project folder with starter files |
| 3    | Edit `Cargo.toml` | Adds libraries for web server and JSON |
| 4    | Edit `main.rs` | Replaces default code with web server logic |
| 5    | `cargo run`   | Compiles and starts the server |
| 6    | `curl ...`    | Confirms the server is working |
